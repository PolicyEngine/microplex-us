# microplex-us

`microplex-us` is the US content package for Microplex. It ships declarative
specs and manifests only; Microplex owns the execution engine, microimpute owns
donor imputation, and microcalibrate owns calibration.

## Package Contents

- `src/microplex_us/specs/us-2024.yaml`: US 2024 construction spec.
- `src/microplex_us/manifests/ecps_export_contract.json`: frozen eCPS export
  column contract.
- `src/microplex_us/manifests/frozen_production_ecps_2024_benchmark_manifest.json`:
  pinned production-eCPS benchmark certificate metadata.
- `src/microplex_us/manifests/pe_source_impute_blocks.json`: source-imputation
  block declarations.
- `src/microplex_us/manifests/puf.json`: PUF source manifest.

## Construction Order

1. Load ASEC/CPS and PUF sources.
2. Build the seeded 50/50 ASEC+PUF support spine.
3. Assign atomic census geography within the lowest available CPS geography.
4. Run SCF, SIPP, and ACS source imputations on the resolved support universe.
5. Apply declared transforms and target construction.
6. Calibrate through Microplex's microcalibrate adapter.
7. Export the PolicyEngine-compatible dataset.

## Validation

The generic Microplex content-package check validates that the spec loads, the
variable manifest covers the frozen eCPS contract plus declared imputation
surface, and the package contains no runtime Python files.
